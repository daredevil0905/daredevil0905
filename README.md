# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## About Me
I absolutely love building new stuff. And that's the reason why I ended up taking 'Computer Applications' in school. Now 6 years later, here I am! Although I did not begin learning development until in my late third-year of university, I have quickly found a niche for it. Every incremental change brings with it a new scope for growth, and that is something that I value a lot. I strive to be a part of the top 1% of the developer community and I am constantly learning something new everyday to reach that goal. I am proficient in Next.js, React.js & TypeScript on the frontend part and Go & Python for the backend. I am gladly up for a chat if you are hiring for a Full Stack role!
